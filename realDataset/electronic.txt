But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors


Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want him too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe... the...
Lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'


TELL ME YOUR STORY. I'LL TELL YOU MINE.
SING ME YOUR SONG I'LL FOLLOW LINE BY LINE.
DRAW ME NEAR LET ME HEAR THE THINGS YOU'VE TREASURED.
PATIENT AS FALLING SNOW STANDING INSIDE THE QUESTIONS.
NEVER GUESSING THAT WITH TRUTHS OUR SOULS ARE MEASURED.
EACH OF US RISING FROM WORLDS UNKNOWN.

WITHIN YOUR TRIALS I'LL SEE MY OWN.
STILL THERE ARE JOURNEY'S THAT ARE YOURS ALONE.
YOU WERE BORN FOR THE STORM YOU HAVE TO WEATHER.
TRUE AS A THE WINTER WIND YOU FACED THE MOMENT BRAVELY.
YOU AND I WE'RE ON OUR OWN AND YET TOGETHER.
WALKING A PATH WE CAN'T DEFINE.

OOOO DEE AH (AD LIB)

TELL ME YOUR STORY, I'LL TELL YOU MINE.
SING ME YOUR SONG I'LL FOLLOW LINE BY LINE.
LET THE NIGHT FALL WITH THE LIGHTNESS OF A FEATHER.
TRUSTING THE COMING DAWN.
WE CANNOT HOLD THE MORNING.

I've done this too much cause I been alone
I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you

Moments like these are golden
Never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you
So breath my air, and kiss me there

Out of my chest when you put it there

Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

She asked me if I do this every day, I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often

Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it

Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '99, wear sunscreen
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will never understand the power
And the beauty of your youth until they've faded
But trust me, in twenty years
You will look back at photos of yourself

And recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you
And how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying
Is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation
By chewing bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
That never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you, sing
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours, floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself

Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements, stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life

The most interesting people
I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to knees, you'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the "Funky Chicken"
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own, dance
Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together will make it through
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people
You knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel, accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old
And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders, don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you'll never know when either one will run out
Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're forty
It will look eighty-five
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of
Wishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together will make it through, oh yeah
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Everybody's free, oh yeah, everybody's free, oh yeah, oh, to feel good


You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together
You'll be fine
Tell me what the hell do you know
What do you know
Tell me how the hell could you know
How could you know

'Til it happens to you, you don't know
How it feels
How it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know
It won't be real
No it won't be real
Won't know how it feels

You tell me hold your head up
Hold your head up and be strong
'Cause when you fall, you gotta get up
You gotta get up and move on

Tell me, how the hell could you talk
How could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk
It's just all talk

'Til it happens to you, you don't know
How it feels
How it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know
It won't be real (how could you know?)
No it won't be real (how could you know?)
Won't know how I feel

'Til your world burns and crashes
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope
'Til you're standing in my shoes, I don't wanna hear nothing from you
From you, from you, 'cause you don't know

'Til it happens to you, you don't know
How I feel
How I feel
How I feel
'Til it happens to you, you won't know
It won't be real (how could you know?)
No it won't be real (how could you know?)
Won't know how it feels

'Til it happens to you, happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you, happens to you
Happens to you (how could you know?)

'Til it happens to you, you won't know how I feel


Like a kid and her teddy bear
Like a leaf blowing in the air
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

Like a flag after a war
When you're gone or when you're first born
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

'Cause I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Right into your distant hands
Could you carry me?
Right back where we started from
Could you carry me?

On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on, could you carry me?
Back to where we started from

'Member when we would dance all night
Parking lots and velvet skies
I was there for you
And you were there for me

Every time we would start a fight
We'd make love 'til the morning light
I was there for you
And you were there for me

So I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us
So I need to know

Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Right into your distant hands

Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice

Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath

Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep

Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep

A-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day
A-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day


For now you can stay,
Right here we will play,
Until somehow you can find,
A slightly different Frame of Mind

Right here in my arms,
Away from all harm,
You'll be safe from all the flares,
Although I know you don't care

(Wooo repeated)

You can lift your head up to the sky,
Take a deeper breath and give it time,
You can walk the path among the lines,
With your shattered Frame of Mind

Or instead you could always stay,
We can wait right here and play,
Until somehow you can find,
A slightly better Frame of Mind

(Wooo repeated)

When they say you will fall,
You can reach nothing at all,
Hide your tracks,
Beneath the rind,
Of a different Frame of Mind

Is that what you heard,
Broken words in the dirt,
Yelling out, into the Sun,

Here we come,
Here we come

(Wooo repeated)
Here we come....Here we come
(Wooo repeated)
Here we come....Here we come
(Wooo repeated)

You can lift your head up to the sky,
Take a deeper breath and give it time,
You can walk the path among the lines,
With your shattered Frame of Mind

Or instead you could always stay,
We can wait right here and play,
Until somehow you can find,
A slightly better Frame of Mind

(Wooo repeated)

You can lift your head up to the sky,
Take a deeper breath and give it time,
You can walk the path among the lines,
With your shattered Frame of Mind

Or instead you could always stay,
We can wait right here and play,
Until somehow you can find,
A slightly better Frame of Mind

And when daylight comes through,
When the day is anew,
Then it will be time,
For a new Frame of Mind

When all eyes are on you,
You will know what to do,
Since you would have found,
Your new Frame of Mind

When you lift your head up to the sky,
Take a deeper breath and give it time,
You can walk the path among the lines,

But always know that you'll be safe,
I'll be here throughout your days,
Come find me and we will play,

Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking.
When there are clouds in the sky
you'll get by.

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
For you.

Light up your face with gladness,
Hide every trace of sadness.
Although a tear may be ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying.
You'll find that life is still worthwhile-
If you just smile.

A clock ticks 'till it breaks your glass a
And I drown in you again

'Cause you are, the piece of me,
I wish, I didn't need
Chasing, relentlessly,
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love, is tragedy,
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's, insanity,
Why are you my clarity?

If you pull, then I'll push too deep a
And I'll fall right back to you

I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to forbes list, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, kevin costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a queen street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Say, say say
I come from myrtle, one brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lighting, tightening, strapped with ak
Say, say, say
Og one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Like number ten
With like women up women art with women up
Gon' get it, good game
She wanna hang with a starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, these nine of us
And 5 of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh god bless the dead (yeah)
I'm livin' life high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you so scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Sidewalks saved my life
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on


You were looking at me like you wanted to stay
When I saw you yesterday
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games
I see you

Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now

No one but you got me feeling this way
There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you

Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now
Come on, come on, come on now
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now

Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon

Star Trek roof in that Wrath of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know
I can fly high, I can go long
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know
I can fly high, I can go long
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know

Stop crying like you're home and think about the show
We're all playing the same game, laying down alone
We're unknown and wrong, special when I come
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
I feel so out of sea
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I go alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I never make it out
What I mean to you, do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

All the years
All the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free


What I would do to take away this fear of being loved
Allegiance to the pain
Now I fucked up and I miss you
I'll never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I fucked up and I miss you
I'll never be like you

I'm only human, can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it
Ooh, never be like you

I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it
Ooh, never be like you

How do I make you wanna stay?
Hate sleeping on my own, missing the way you taste
Now I'm fucked up and I miss you
Never be like you
Stop looking at me with those eyes
Like I could disappear and you wouldn't care why
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
Never be like you

I'm only human, can't you see?
I made, I made a mistake

Absolve me of my sins, won't you?

Oh, I'm falling on my knees

Baby, baby please believe me
C'mon, take it easy

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it

And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it

There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now ?the memories are on the wall
I hear the sounds from the places where I was born

Up on the hill across the blue lake,
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world,
Thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs, reminding me of a friend

Up on the hill across the blue lake,
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now

Recommend play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I sweat too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face coming off a bag a blow
I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these RnB niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane

You know man, you know man, you know man
Everytime we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know man (pow! pow!), you know man

Said Im just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Wrap a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bedsprings we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you cause

You know man, you know man
You know man, you know man
Everytime we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know man (pow! pow!), you know man

Why don't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Big girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing
Big girl won't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Baby girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing

I'll die way before Methuselah
So I'll fight sleep with ammonia
And every morning, with eyes all red
I'll miss them for all the tears they shed

But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we

I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

I miss prosthesis and mended souls
Trample over beauty while singing their thoughts
I match them with my euphoria
When they said, "je suis plus folle que toi"

But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we

I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

Nous et la manne on est de sortie
Pire qu'une simple moitié
On compte à demi-demi
Pile sur un des bas côtés
Comme des origamis
Le bras tendu paraît cassé
Tout n'est qu'épis et éclis

Ces enfants bizarres
Crachés dehors comme par hasard
Cachant l'effort dans le griffoir
Et une creepy song en étendard
Qui fait

I'm doing my face
With magic marker
I'm in my right place
Don't be a downer

I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger
I've got, so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shiver with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm, can you
Show me how we can escape

(Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh ooh)
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
(Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh ooh)
I'll forget what I've done
I'll be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Now that we can hear that sound
Now that you can hold me down
You can pull me under
You can raise everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange,
Every part of me you change
Just hold me together, tell me
You'll always want me to stay

(Ooh oh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh)
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
(Ooh oh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh)
I'll forget what I've done
I'll be redefined

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love, that your love
Can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That you'll love, that you'll love

It's shaking the sky
And I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight

You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've be waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've be waiting to find
It's you that I've be waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find


This will never end
Cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

This will never end
Cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings

If I had a voice I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame
Will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me more

Crushed and filled with all I found underneath and inside
Just to come around
More, give me more, give me more

If I had a voice I would sing


It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are
She said, 'cause He made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up,
girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice of truth
In the religion of the insecure

I can feel the floor shaking, and the glass begin to break
The air is getting thinner with every breath that I take,
The calm before the storm, you can hear the drop of a pin
Never been claustrophobic, but now the walls are closing in

I've crossed every line, broken every boundary
And now it's retribution time 'cause the church that I went to
It ain't that holy

So, strike me down, take me away
Debts are due, it's time to pay
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day
I won't run, the guilt is mine
Too long denying all my crimes
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day

All the love I have taken
All the hearts I've turned to hate
Hearts are easily broken when you've been made in the shade
Crossed every line, broken every boundary
And now it's retribution time 'cause the church that i went to
It ain't that holy

Strike me down, take me away
Debts are due, it's time to pay
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day
I won't run, the guilt is mine
Too long denying all my crimes
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day

Standing at the gate
Ready to meet my fate
Cleanse my soul it's not too late
So bring on judgement day

Strike me down, take me away
Debts are due, it's time to pay
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day
I won't run, the guilt is mine
Too long denying all my crimes
Face what I deserve, here comes judgement day

And who are you, the proud lord said,
that I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat,
that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold or a coat of red,
a lion still has claws,
And mine are long and sharp, my Lord,
as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
that lord of Castamere,
But now the rains weep o'er his hall,
with no one there to hear.

Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall,
and not a soul to hear.

They try to copy your moves
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully

[Intro]
The title, "Mania", appears in bold, red capital letters.

[1: "All I Know" Scene]
Murphy the panther is in the center of an arena-like area. A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.

[2: "Sidewalks" Scene]
Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song. There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. Abel continues singing along to "Sidewalks" in his expensive vehicle. Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.

[3: "Secrets" Scene]
There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1. He walks into the nightclub. "Secrets" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.

[4: "Die For You" Scene]
Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. The music stops and Murphy roars.

[5: "Party Monster" Scene]
Abel is covered in blood. The man is lay dead on the floor, still bleeding. The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit, she presumably saved Abel from being knifed. The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song as it plays in the background. Cut to flashing blue lights.

Hey, brother, what you thinking?
Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm, going
(They call it lonely digging)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees a-bending, so
It's time to get up and let go
(You're gonna come undone)

Hey, mama, how's it going?
Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying
(They call it lonely digging)
Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's ready, set, go

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
So we can get with 'em
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

Hey, brother, what you thinking?
That good ol' sound is ringing
They don't know what they're missing
(They call it lonely digging)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees a-bending, so
It's time to get up and let go

Hey, brother, nice and steady
Put down your drink, you ready
It's hard when things get messy
(They call it lonely digging)
Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's ready, set, go

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
So we can get with 'em
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene


[Pharrell Williams Vocals]

Like the legend of the Phoenix,
All ends with beginnings.
What keeps the planets spinning,
The force from the beginning.

[Pre-Chorus:]
We've come too far
To give up who we are,
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars.

[Chorus:]
She's up all night till the sun,
I'm up all night to get some.
She's up all night for good fun,
I'm up all night to get lucky.

We're up all night till the sun,
We're up all night to get some.
We're up all night for good fun,
We're up all night to get lucky.

[Post-Chorus:]
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.

The present has no ribbon,
Your gift keeps on giving.
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it.

[All Chorus]

[Daft Punk Bridge:]
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...

We're up all night to get
We're up all night (let's get back again).
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get luck

We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.

[All Chorus]


We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding into the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, when it's never enough
As the silence filled the lonely air
Oh, they can hear now now now baby
We see a storm is closing in,
Pretending we're escaping

Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, no no
A quarter tank is almost gone,
Pretending we're in love, when it's never enough
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line, no now now, baby
We see a storm is closing in
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

Oh oh, hold on, oh yeah, hold on

Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on
Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
