When I get older, I will be stronger They'll call me freedom Just like a waving flag When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back To the throne, stronger than Rome But violent prone, poor people zone, But it's my home, all I have known, Where I got grown, streets we would roam. But out of the darkness, I came the farthest, Among the hardest survival. Learn from these streets, it can be bleak, Accept no defeat Surrender retreat So we struggling, fighting to eat and We wondering when we'll be free, So we patiently wait, for that fateful day, It's not far away, so for now we say meaning  byPraveendube05 Who does it refer to in the line- " born to a throne, stronger than Rome"? See all When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back So many wars, settling scores, Bringing us promises, leaving us poor, I heard them say, love is the way, Love is the answer, that's what they say, But look how they treat us, make us believers, We fight their battles, then they deceive us, Try to control us, they couldn't hold us, 'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers. But we struggling, fighting to eat, And we wondering, when we'll be free So we patiently wait, for that faithful day, It's not far away, but for now we say, When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back And everybody will be singing it And you and I will be singing it And we all will be singing it When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back When I get older, when I get older I will be stronger, just like a waving flag, Just like a waving flag, just like a waving flag Flag, flag, just like a waving flag
