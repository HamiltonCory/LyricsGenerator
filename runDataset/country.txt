For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh baby I need you now


Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh I've got friends in low places

I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay.


Saw you early this morning
Sleepin' all dressed in white
For a moment I thought you were an angel
Come to take me home alive
You woke up and you caught me staring
Smiled and said "Hey cut it out"
I said that I must be crazy
I said crazy 'bout you and I kissed you on the mouth

[Chorus]
And if I am truly crazy
Don't you know I like my life that way
And if I'm really goin' on out of my mind
Won't you hop on board and make your getaway

Took a walk on down the seashore
Saw a beggar pickin' up some cans
Saw a little boy who had some songs in his eyes
Reachin' out for his mama's hand
Watched a stranger give that man a dollar
Watched the mama wipe the tears from the little boy's eyes
And then I stared up to the heavens
Said "Oh Lord I'm glad that I'm alive,
Glad that I'm alive"

[Chorus]

Wake up in the morning and turn all the lights on
Turn em out at night so we can hide
Sometimes I sleep with all the lights on
It helps me to appreciate the night
People talk about life all the time
Oh they remember times so sad
Don't you think life would be awfully boring
If the good times were all that we had

[Chorus: x2]


I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city, where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one, that's silver lined

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we'll never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

Though often tempted, tormented and tempted
And like the prophet my pillow is stone
And though I find here no permanent dwelling
I know he'll give me a mansion my own

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we'll never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

Don't think me poor Lord, deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged, 'cause I'm heaven bound
I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city
I want a mansion, a harp, and a crown

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold


(Dolly Parton)

If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you

And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love

I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you


Every time our eyes meet, there is a feelin' inside me
Its almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me, I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
Ive never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams

I dunno how you do, what you do, Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, Im amazed by you

The smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark, your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me, you touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time, every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I dunno how you do, what you do, Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, Im amazed by you

Every little thing that you do, Every little thing that you do, I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, every little thing that you do

Baby, I'm amazed by you


I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm it's time you here 'em

In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know

You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
Yeah you had my heart a long, long time ago
Mmm, in case you didn't know
No, no in case you didn't know


When you came in the air went out.
And every shadow filled up with doubt.
I don't know who you think you are,
But before the night is through,
I wanna do bad things with you.

I'm the kind to sit up in his room.
Heart sick an' eyes filled up with blue.
I don't know what you've done to me,
But I know this much is true:
I wanna do bad things with you.

When you came in the air went out.
And all those shadows there filled up with doubt.
I don't know who you think you are,
But before the night is through,
I wanna do bad things with you.
I wanna do real bad things with you.
Ow, ooh.

I don't know what you've done to me,
But I know this much is true:
I wanna do bad things with you.
I wanna do real bad things with you.


Verse 1

Well when I was kid I'd take a trip
Every summer
Down to Mississippi
To visit my granny in her ante bellum world
I'd run barefooted all day long
Climbing trees free as a song
One day I happened catch myself a squirrel
I stuffed him down in an old shoebox
Punched a couple holes in the top and when Sunday came
I snuck him into church
I was sittin way back in the very last pew
Showin him to my good buddy Hugh
When that squirrel got loose
And went totally berserk!Well what happened next is hard to tell
Some thought it was Heaven others thought it was Hell
But the fact that something was among us
Was plain to see

As the choir sang "I Surrender All"
The squirrel ran up Harv Newlan's coveralls
Harv leaped to his feet and said
"Somethin's got a hold on me! YEOW!"

Chorus

The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!

Verse 2

Well, Harv hit the aisles dancin' and screamin'
Some thought he had religion
Others thought he had a demon
And Harv thought he had a weed eater loose in his Fruit-Of-The-Looms
He fell to his knees to plead and beg
And the squirrel ran out of his britches leg
Unobserved, to the other side of the room

All the way down to the amen pew
Where sat Sister Bertha better-than-you
Who'd been watchin' all the commotion with sadistic glee
But you should've seen the look in her eyes
When that squirrel jumped her garters and crossed her thighs
She jumped to her feet and said "Lord have mercy on me"
As the squirrel made laps inside her dress
She began to cry and then to confess to sins that would make a sailor blush with shame
She told of gossip and church dissension but the thing that got the most attention
Was when she talked about her love life
And then she started naming names!

Chorus

The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!

Verse 3

Well seven deacons and then the pastor got saved
And 25,000 dollars got raised
And 50 volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot
And even without an invitation
There were at least 500 rededications
And we all got re-baptized whether we needed it or not

Now you've heard the Bible stories I guess
Of how He parted the waters for Moses to pass
All the miracles God has brought to this ol' world
But the one I'll remember to my dyin day
Is how he put that church back on the narrow way
With a half-crazed Mississippi squirrel

The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
Of that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Halelujah!


I like sugar and I like tea
but I don't like niggers, no sir-e
there's two lone things that'll make me puke
that's a hog eatin' slop and a big black spook

You know it, 'cuz I show it
like a barnyard rooster I crow it
an' the NAACP would sure like to get
a hold of nigger hatin' me.

Roses are red an' violets are blue an'
niggers are black, you know that's true
but they don't mind 'cuz what the heck
you gotta' be black to get a welfare check.

..an' I'm broke, no joke. I ain't got a nickle
for a coke and I ain't black you see, so Uncle
Sam won't help poor nigger hatin' me.

Jigga-boo Jigga-boo where are you? I was
here on the woodpile watching you. Jigga-boo
Jigga-boo come outdoors. No! I'sa scared of the
white man way down south.

You know it, 'cuz I show it. Stick your black
head out an' I'll blow it and the NAACP can't keep
you away from 'lil 'ol nigger hatin' me.

Mirror mirror on the wall who is the blackest
of them all? A man named King it ain't no doubt
and he's causin' lots of trouble with his baboon
mouth. The ruin he's a doin' is caused by the
trouble he's a brewin' and the NAACP can't win if
the white man stick with nigger hatin' me.

Hey Mr. President whattayasay? When are we
whites gonna have our day? The niggers' had
theirs such a long long time. I'm a white an'
it's time that I have mine.

You know it, 'cuz I show it. Stick your black head
out an' I'll blow it and the NAACP can't win if the
white man stick with nigger hatin' me.

Nigger hatin me' x4


I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
Ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you now

I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I got a girl crush
I got a girl crush

I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried,
I can't get her off my mind

I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I got a girl crush
I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down


Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
'Cause tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone

Help me make it through the night

I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
For tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone

Help me make it through the night

I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night


My mother told me something that everyone should know
It's all about the devil and I learned to hate him so
She said he causes trouble when you let him in the room
He will never ever leave you if your heart is filled with bloom."

So let the sunshine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never wins
So let the sunshine in, patient with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

When you are unhappy the devil wears a grin
But aw, he starts to running when the rain comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hanging round.

So let the sunshine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never wins
So let the sunshine in, patient with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

If I forget to say my prayers the devil jumps with plea
But all he feels so awful when he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble and you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

So let the sunshine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never wins
So let the sunshine in, patient with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in


If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison never, shoot goodbye
Beat regret when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound fear to a pile of sand
Choke lonely out with my bare hands
I'd hang hate so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

I'd take brokenness out back
And break heartbreak, stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put upset down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of disgrace
Lay over under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
'Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn lies and hate to love and truth
If I could only kill a word

I'd knock out temptation's teeth
I'd sever evil, let it bleed
Then light up wicked, stand and watch it burn
I'd take vice and I'd take vile
And tie 'em up there with hostile
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word


I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn't four am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it I know
The bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Better man


When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go blind for you
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

Storms are raging on a rolling sea
Down the highway of regret
Winds of change are blowing wild and free, yeah huh
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet

There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love


As I kneel before you,
As I bow my head in prayer,
Take this day, make it yours
and fill me with your love.
Refrain:
Ave Maria,
Gratia plena,
Dominus tecum,
Benedicta tu.
All I have I give you,
Every dream and wish are yours,
Mother of Christ,
Mother of mine, present them to my Lord.
(Repeat Refrain)
As I kneel before you,
And I see your smiling face
Ev'ry thought, ev'ry word
Is lost in your embrace.
(Repeat Refrain)


Well, I woke up early Sunday mornin'
Had myself a piece of toast
Had 50 dollars in my pocket
Gonna chase myself a ghost

Went down Camino Espinoza
Gonna get me a divorce
I'm gonna split with all my money
See that girl who loves a horse

It's 'New Year's Day' here on the border
And it's always been this way
I never do the things, I oughta
I think I'll stay, it's 'New Year's Day'

Well, I met 'em, boys they're from ol' Connor
Cowboy like you've never seen
They're up for anything you want to
Live on steak and refried beans

They bought up half of Southern Texas
It's why they act the way they do
When 'em, boys meet me in Laredo
They think they own Laredo too

It's 'New Year's Day' here on the border
And it's always been this way
I never do the things, I oughta
I think I'll stay, it's 'New Year's Day'

Well, I know a girl here in Laredo
Her name's Pussy Willow Rose
She got that ring 'round the collar
Got that ring stuck through her nose

She works there, at the Dallas Cowboys
But she got no in between
Like all them, other boys in dresses
They ain't every cowboys dream

It's 'New Year's Day' here on the border
And it's always been this way
I never do the things, I oughta
I think I'll stay, it's 'New Year's Day'

It's 'New Year's Day' here on the border
And it's always been this way
I never do the things, I oughta
I think I'll stay, it's 'New Year's Day'


A bright sunrise will contradict the heavy fault that weighs you down
In spite of all the funeral songs
The birds will make their joyful sounds
You wonder why the earth still moves

You wonder how you'll carry on
But you'll be okay on that first day when I'm gone
Dusk will come with fireflies and whippoorwill and crickets call
And every star will take its place

And silvery gown and purple shawl
You'll lie down in our big bed
Dread the dark and dread the dawn
But you'll be alright on that first night when I'm gone

You will reach for me in vain
You'll be whispering my name
As if sorrow were your friend
And this world so in the end

But life will call with daffodil
And morning glorious blue skies
You'll think of me some memory
And softly smile to your surprise

And even though you love me still
You will know where you belong
Just give it time we'll both be fine
When I'm gone


Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof
Talkin' to the moon

Coutin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon

As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls
Girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon

As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin havin a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon

As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin havin a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

Ya no matter how late I'll be stayin up I can't sleep without you no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss


The first thing I remember knowing,
Was a lonesome whistle blowing,
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride,
On a freight train leaving town,
Not knowing where I'm bound,
No-one could change my mind but Mama tried.
One and only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild,
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store.
Despite my Sunday learning,
Towards the bad, I kept turning.
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore.

And I turned twenty-one in prion doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul,
Left my Mom a heavy load,
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.
Working hours without rest,
Wanted me to have the best.
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried,
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.


Whoa I, I just wanna ease your mind
Put your doubts to bed tonight
Lay down and let me tell you
You're, you're the kind of once in our lives
That lock it down don't come around twice
I guess what I'm sayin'
This heart of mine ain't playin'

If you were this guitar, I'd turn it to eleven
If you were an angel, I'd pray to go to heaven
If they wouldn't let me in, I'd break the gates down
I'd break 'em all down
If you were on the other side of the world
I'd spin that thing right back around just to get to you girl
I love the way you always go and mess me up
If you were a whiskey, girl, I'd be a damn drunk

Oh hey, go on and roll those pretty blue eyes
Laugh and say boy you lie
Girl I wouldn't dare
Dare to make you love me more
I can take that on for sure
'Cause what we got is crazy, crazy good

If you were this guitar, I'd turn it to eleven
If you were an angel, I'd pray to go to heaven
If they wouldn't let me in, I'd break the gates down
I'd break 'em all down
If you were on the other side of the world
I'd spin that thing right back around just to get to you girl
I love the way you always go and mess me up
If you were a whiskey, girl, I'd be a damn drunk


She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down,
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out,
The dogs were all barking and wagging around,
And I just laughed and said y'all get in,
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair,
She was looking too good not to go somewhere,
Said what you want to do baby I don't care,
We can go to the show we can stay out here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter,
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around,
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down,
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out,
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter,
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust off the seat,
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Oh yeah yeah,
We can go to town,
Or we can go another round,
On my big green tractor.


Country music singers
Have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolk
Have disowned a few others and me

I guess it's because
I kinda changed my direction
And Lord, I guess I went
And broke their family tradition
They get on me want to know

Hank, why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out
The songs that you wrote?

Over and over
Everybody met my prediction
So if I get stoned I'm just carryin'
On an old family tradition

I am very proud
Of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music
And mine ain't exactly the same

Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long
It's a family tradition

So don't ask me
Hank, why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out
The songs that you wrote?

If I'm down in a honky tonk
Some old slicks trying to give my friction
I say leave me alone I'm singin' all night long
It's a family tradition

Lordy, I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973

When my doctor asked me
"Son, how'd you get in this condition?"
I said "Hey sawbones, I'm just carryin' on
An old family tradition"

So don't ask me
Hank, why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out
The songs that you wrote?

Stop and think it over
Try to put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long
It's a family tradition


Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way

Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet

Nine to five, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet


I'm still running 33s up underneath this truck
Even though rush hour concrete is the only place
I'm getting stuck
Ain't on the farm no more but on a stretch of sunny days
I still catch myself looking up at the sky
Praying for a little rain

No I can't outrun these roots
Even if I wanted to
'Cause they run too strong, run too deep
Cutting right through the heart of me
No it don't matter where I plant these boots
Can't outrun these roots
I can't outrun these roots.

There's still that back-home part of me,
That can't help but see things a little differently
Like how there ain't no need
To put a 'G' on the end of huntin' or fishin'
And I still got granddaddy's bible
His old rifle and his name
But I also got his pour a little more
Coarsin' through my veins

Thank God I can't
They're tangled up in every part of who I am
Without 'em I know I don't stand a chance
I can't outrun these roots


This world is not my home I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

I have a loving mother just over in gloryland
And I don't expect to stop until I shake her hand
She's waiting now for me in heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home Then lord what will I do

The angels beckon me From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore

Just over in gloryland
We'll live eternally
The saints on every hand are shouting victory

Their songs of sweetest praise
Drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore

Oh lord, you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home Then lord what will I do

The angels beckon me From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home In this world anymore


I know your life
On earth was troubled
And only you could know the pain.
You weren't afraid to face the devil,
You were no stranger to the rain.

Go rest high on that mountain
Son,your work on earth is done.
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son.

Oh,how we cried the day you left us
We gathered round your grave to grieve.
I wish I could see the angels faces
When they hear your sweet voice sing.

Go rest high on that mountain
Son,your work on earth is done.
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son.


Baby, lock the doors and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

There's no hurry, don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer, let's go over
What I had in mind

Baby, lock the doors and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how long I've wanted to

Baby, lock the doors and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man


If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song,
Uh oh, Uh oh

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and, life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but sheburies her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
As green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand

There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny, when you're dead how people start listen'n

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn'
Send me away with the words of a love song

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them,
The sharp knife of a short life oh
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on."

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh


When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall could only bring the rain
I sat in darkness, all broken hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losing hope
But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me

You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleanse all the demons
That were killing my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singing babe, hallelujah
We'll be touching, we'll be touching heaven

You're an angel, tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you

You're the healing hands where it used to hurt
You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church

You're holy


There's a girl somewhere in Tupelo
Who's with a guy she barely knows
Probably sell his soul for a kiss

There's a girl somewhere in Arkansas
Who's talking with a southern drawl
And a guy who can't stop staring at her lips

Ain't it crazy how they make us all so crazy?

Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made
Get tattoos
Wash our trucks
Push and press our luck

Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands
And change our plans
Lose our minds
Break our hearts
And learn to play guitar

Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl

There's a girl somewhere with eyes so blue
You know a call just won't do
So here I am on highway forty-five

First girl to get me to ask myself how I'd be with anyone else
Any other minute of my life

Ain't it something how they get us doing something?

Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made
Get tattoos
Wash our trucks
Push and press our luck

Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands
And change our plans
Lose our minds
Break our hearts
And learn to play guitar

Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl

Ain't it crazy how they get us going crazy?

Why would we drive six hundred miles one way?
Blow through cash that we ain't made
Get tattoos
Wash our trucks
Push and press our luck

Why would we ask when we know we can't dance?
Show our hands
And change our plans
Lose our minds
Break our hearts
And learn to play guitar

Why does any man do anything in the whole damn world?
'Cause there's a girl
'Cause there's a girl


I, the Lord of sea and sky,
I have heard My people cry.
All who dwell in dark and sin,
My hand will save.
I who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright.
Who will bear My light to them?
Whom shall I send?

Here I am Lord, Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.

I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne my people's pain.
I have wept for love of them, They turn away.
I will break their hearts of stone,
Give them hearts for love alone.
I will speak My word to them
Whom shall I send?

Here I am Lord, Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.

I, the Lord of wind and flame
I will tend the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them,
My hand will save
Finest bread I will provide,
Till their hearts be satisfied.
I will give My life to them,
Whom shall I send?

Here I am Lord, Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night.
I will go Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.


The mix tape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll

Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll

Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day

This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby
This is how we roll

Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll


You know there's a lot that goes by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
Childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be a waste of time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got moutains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
I love you ain't no pick up line so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got moutains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind


Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Well I've been away from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
And I believe my heart has turned to stone

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I don't say anything at all
Well God don't listen to the noise
Now I'm left here all alone

Ooh, oh, I hear what the neighbors say
That that poor boy has lost his way
And I let the others pray

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I do my talking with a gun
And blood will spill into the gutters
And it will stain the morning sun

Ooh, oh tell me what the hell I've done
Can I stop at one?
Or have I just begun?

Take out the bodies that live
Oh, Lord, it gets me high
I think I'm gonna get my fill
Of taking lives

Oh, Lord, I don't wanna let my baby down
Well I just wanna give us something one of a kind

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
I've been a stray from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
Hell is leaving the light on

And ooh, oh they'll hang me way up high
God himself will drop me from the sky
And let me swing a while

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?

What have I done?


In constant sorrow through his days

I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised

The place where he was born and raised

For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now

He has no friends to help him now

It's fare thee well my old lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train

Perhaps he'll die upon this train

You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

While he is sleeping in his grave

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

He'll meet you on God's golden shore


Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her "baby"
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks around town with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky


She don't laugh at everything but when she does the planet swings around her
She don't step on sidewalks seams, her teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the vegas lights, she blow a kiss and leave it spinning' like a tilt-a-whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up, she's a pony tail no make-up saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in the summer rain, she could catch the eye of a hurricane
In blue jeans and pearls

I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world

She turned around and it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing I could say was "hey", and I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her, I can't believe I get to be here in her world
I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

I met a girl


I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through

I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
That every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes it did

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
And others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know it's true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yeah

And now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

That God blessed the broken road
Ooh, ooh
That led me straight to you


Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
I am so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind


Well you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be
The choosen one

She said, you're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes

And when you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you
About right and wrong

Hey but you're, but you're looking good, baby
I believe that you're feeling fine, shame about it
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes

'Cause you woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same
Since the blues walked into town

But you're, but you're one in a million
'Cause you got that shotgun shine, boom
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes, yeah

Woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes
Yeah, you woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like some bell from your head down to your toes
Like some voice trying to tell you there's something you should know

Last night you was flying but today you're so low
Times like these makes you wonder if you'll ever know
Meaning of things as they appear to the others
Wives, husbands, fathers, sisters and brothers

Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink'
Well you do make up your mind to go on, 'cos
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone
Everything you had was long gone

You see I woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You wanna be, you wanna be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know it because you, you just can't help yourself

Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah
Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah
Woke up this morning and you did it girl
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun


She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talkin' to her momma on phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl, yeah

Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat, windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene, that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite, in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Every night before she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank him for my girl

Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat, windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene, that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite, in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Oh my girl
Yea that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up (my girl)
In my heart, in my soul, in the air that I breathe every day (that's my girl)
Yeah everything (my girl)

Yeah that's my girl
In the passenger seat, windows down dancing around
Causin' a scene, that's my girl
Sippin' crown and sprite, in a ball cap turned back
Ooh she got me like
Yeah baby girl you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wish you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Oh, my girl
Yeah, that's my girl


Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance
To tell her how I feel
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes


From the dusty mesa
Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood

In the hushing dusk under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
And strange hands halted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt the trembling hands

When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones

And rise with me forever
Across the silent sand
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my hands


Many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed

This made my dad my son-in-law and really changed my life
For now my daughter was my mother, 'cause she was my father's wife
And to complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy

My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For if he were my uncle, then that also made him brother
Of the widow's grownup daughter, who was of course my step-mother

Father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too

Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild
And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild
'Cause now I have become the strangest 'case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny, I know but it really is so
I'm my own grandpa


Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying
Her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey

Right now, he's probably up behind her
With a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky

Right now, he's probably
Dabbing on three dollars
Worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me!
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh


My eyes have seen the glory of the tramplin at the zoo,
We washed our hands in niggers blood and all the mongrals too,
We're bringing down the zog machine jew by jew by jew,
The white man marches on

Glory, Glory Blood of Honor
Glory, Glory Blood of Honor
Glory, Glory Blood of Honor
The White Man Marches On!


Now a red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues tailgates fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass

A red solos cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not fore-closable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass woo

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Now I really love how your easy to stack
But I really hate how your easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well that my friends is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring how sharply my first name is written
On you with a sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you red will do for this fellow
'Cause you are my Abbot to my Costello
And you are the fruit to my loom

Red solo cup you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red solo cup, you're not just a cup. (No, no, God no)
You're my, you're my friend. (Friend, friend, friend, life long)
Thank you for being my friend.

Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party

Red solo cup, red solo cup (I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party (Let's have a party) Let's have a party
(Red solo cup) Oh red solo cup (I lift you up)
Let's have a party, proceed to party yeah yeah


Well, it was all
That I could do to keep from crying'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me charlie pride
And you don't have to call me Merle haggard/anymore
Even though you're on my fighting' side

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name

Well, I've heard my name
A few times in your phone book (hello, hello)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know
I'll hear "David Allan Coe"
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter
And I told him it was not the perfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama,
Or trains,
Or trucks,
Or prison,
Or getting' drunk
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song
And he sent it to me,
And after reading it,
I realized that my friend had written the perfect
Country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
No, a' you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me
Well I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name


I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi

And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
But don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not gonna waste it
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

And I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You could have rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could have walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

Woah, I don't wanna go home with you
Woah, I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

And I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time, ooh


Bring me sunshine in your smile
Bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow

Make me happy through the years
Never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun bring me sunshine, bring me love

Bring me sunshine in your smile
Bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow

Make me happy through the years
Never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun bring me sunshine, bring me love


The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and a true spear
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of that moon

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

When you're searching the horizon
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack

Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh


She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Looking back
On the memory of
The dance we shared
'Neath the stars above
For a moment
All the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye

And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance

Holding you
I held everything
For a moment
Wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say
You know I might have changed it all

And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance


Say hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?
Hey, sweet baby
Don't you think maybe
We can find us a brand new recipe?

I got a hot-rod ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancing's free
So if you want to have fun come along with me

Said hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?

I'm free and ready
So we can go steady
How's about saving all your time for me?
No more lookin'
I know I been cookin'
How's about keepin' steady company?

I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'till it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page

Say hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?


I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
And you brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there nothing like your love to gettin' me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time


I can see you over there
Starring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink
All alone tonight

And chances are
You're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while
Baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

I'm not tryna
Be another just
Pick you up
Kinda guy
Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home
But I just don't understand
How another man
Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold

Well, I've had enough to drink
And it's makin'
Me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn't change ya
I'd just paint you bright
Baby

'Cause blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color
No no no
Blue ain't your colour baby
Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you
You don't need that guy
It's so black and white
He's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

Blue ain't your color, umm mm
No, no baby
Call me baby
Let me light up your world


I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fools game, hopin' to win
Tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

I was alone then, no love in sight
I did everything I could to get me through the night
I don't know where it started or where it might end
I turned to a stranger just like a friend

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

You came knockin' on my heart's door
You're everything I've been looking for

No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and lover
God bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and lover
God bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love


She said someday I'd understand
What love was all about
She said I could have the kids
She was movin out
Said she'd finally found a man
Who's dick was so much bigger
Then that scumbag motherfucker
Run off with a nigger

And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big, black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A greasy nigger

He treated her just like a queen
She gave him all my money
It looks like the joke's on me
But I don't think it's funny
That pussy ain't worth payin for
As far as I can figure
Cause there's nothing quite as worthless
As a white girl with a nigger

And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big, black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A God damn nigger
So for all you nigger lovin whores
This song is just for you


On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends

And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again

Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again

And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way

And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends

And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again

Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends

And I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road again


I bet my friends are wondering
Where I am or if I'm still alive
They're worried over nothing they should know I'm perfectly fine
It's just a mood I get in now and then
When I need to get my head clear
I turn off my phone get lost get gone and flat out disappear

Well there ain't no telling where I'm bound
The big city or the country a little beach town
But you wont find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missing
I'll be back some day I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floating, in the wind
So don't cha go missing me
'Cause sometimes missing is my favorite place to be

I bet the grass is three feet high
And the mailbox is full of bills
Hundred messages I need to check and when I get the chance I will
But right now I'm busy taking it easy
Can't worry bout stuff like that
My only concern is a left or a right turn somewhere on a map

Well there ain't no telling where I'm bound
The big city or the country a little beach town
But you won't find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missing
I'll be back some day I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floatin', in the wind
So don't cha go missing me
'Cause sometimes missing is my favorite place to be

I love those locations where nobody knows my name
How long I'll be stayin' is always subject to change

Well there ain't no telling where I'm bound
The big city or the country a little beach town
But you won't find me 'cause I can't be found
I'm on a mission, to be missing
I'll be back some day I just don't know when
Till then I'll be a feather floatin', in the wind
So don't cha go missing me
'Cause sometimes missing is my favorite place to be


To all the girls I've loved before
Who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls I once caressed
And may I say, I've held the best
For helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know
To all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I tried to stay
The winds of change continued blowing
And they just carried me a way

To all the girls who shared my life
Who now are someone else's wife
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls who cared for me
Who filled my nights with ecstasy
They live within my heart
I'll always be a part
Of all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I tried to stay
The winds of change continued blowing
And they just carried me way

To all the girls we've loved before
Who traveled in and out our door
We're glad they came along
We dedicate this song
To all the girls we've loved before

To all the girls we've loved before
Who traveled in and out our doors
We're glad they came along
We dedicate this song
To all the girls we've loved, before


Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?

Did you know,
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered,
Will soon deliver you.

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?

Mary, did you know
Your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?

Did you know,
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby,
You've kissed the face of god.

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again.
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb.

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is lord of all creation?

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?

Did you know,
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding, is the great I am.

Happy birthday Jesus!
A very merry christmas to all of you!
Please remember
Jesus is the reason for the season!


Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene


Sittin' on the front step
Little white suitcase
Hearing that diesel
'Fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burnin' down a Friday night

Southern Belle statue
Standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world
Head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye

Then I run, to him
Big hug, jump in
And I cry for her
Out the window

Some mommas and daddies
Are loving in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck
In a love triangle

Bowling alley burger
Fries and a milkshake
Heading to the same old
Two-dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been
and how's your mom?

Patsy Cline echoes
Back off the dashboard
Staring at my boots
And the dusty old floorboards
Baby, two weeks ain't really all that long

Then I run, to her
Wrap my arms, around her skirt
And I cry for him
Out the window

Some mommas and daddies
Are loving in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck
In a love triangle (ooh)

Ooh

In a love triangle, yeah

Ooh
Ooh

Some mommas and daddies
Are loving in a straight line
Take forever to heart
And take a long sweet ride
But some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle, oh

And some mommas and daddies
Ran outta love in ninety-four
And some mommas and daddies
Don't even talk no more
And some mommas and daddies
Let their heart strings tear and tangle

And some of us get stuck
And some of us grow up
In a love triangle

Ooh
Ooh


Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, hmm

Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

Baby I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die, I could die a happy man, uh oh hmm
