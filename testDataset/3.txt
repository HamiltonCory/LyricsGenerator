I woke up in Nashville
But it still felt like a dream
Like the one I've been chasing
Since the day I first played my dad's six string


I loaded up the hand-me-down car
Went for broke, broke your heart
Didn't wanna but, girl, I thought I had to
But dreaming's just sleeping here without you


So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby
I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


I woke up in Nashville
Cause those Broadway lights don't shine
The way that your eyes did
When they were staring back
Right back in mine


Been trying to live
With only half of my heart
Just sleep walking in the Tennessee dark
If I can't make every memory with you
Then dreaming's just sleeping here without you


So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby
I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


In a cold sweat
And catching my breath
Dropping my pride
And dropping you a line
I don't know where you are
I don't know who you're with
I don't know what to say
But I'm saying it


So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby
I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up


I woke up in Nashville
Just thinking of you still
